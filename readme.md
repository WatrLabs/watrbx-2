# watrbx 2
roblox revival thats 2016

# info
this is entirely written in php (at least as of right now)

there's also a database migration system and whatnot
to use the migration system
install composer libraries
edit phinx.php
(put in your database info)
then run `vendor/bin/phinx migrate -e development` or whatever your current environment is 

ok bye

# this is a rewrite
or more of a refactor, idk
